This repository provides all challenge contract codes, please refer to the problem solving.

The environment of this competition is a private TON blockchain network. After the platform deploys the challenge contract for you, you need to obtain the contract address and connect to the network through JSON RPC http://65.21.223.95:8081/jsonRPC to try to solve it. You can use various TON development SDKs, such as Typescript SDK. After you generate a test account locally, you can request test coins here http://65.21.223.95:9999.

For tutorials on Tact and Typescript, you can refer to https://docs.tact-lang.org/. There is also a sample code here for your reference https://github.com/TonBitSec/ton-sample.
